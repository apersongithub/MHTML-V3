# MHTML
its open source now enjoy the horrible rushed code i used for this project
**if you're going to skid maybe actually try to improve the site**

# OFFSITE meaning
basically i ran it on a seperate vps

each folder is ran on a seperate vps

i know its horrible but it worked

# main site
if you want to use it for yourself good luck changing everything

# login system
its broken i think

# proxy
not too bad actually but yeah

# EXTRA HELP
most things are controlled via external javascript on the site mainly bg.js and 

bg2.js for the main site otherwise idk

oh also everything is ran in node.js im pretty sure
